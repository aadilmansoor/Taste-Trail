REDUX
-----


props drilling
     - data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component have any issues
     - props drilling occurs during coupling(many connections between parent and child)

 to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components independent

 so react introduced a state management technology - redux

 a js store file  - file from which all the component access data
 action and reducer - to update store file


libraries
    redux 
    react-redux
    redux-thunk
